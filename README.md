## What is this?

This is a (slightly modified) clone of the [official Material Design palette generator](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). It does a couple things:

1. Builds you a full color palette from a given hex color
2. Provides you with complementary colors based off your primary color

Both are based on Material Design standards, and use Google's algorithm for color derivation.

## Why is this?

Google's official palette generator [is embedded and buried deep within the Material docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). Since it's an inline tool, it's also hidden from search engines, making it difficult to discover or bookmark.

To make it a little easier to access and to preserve it for my own future use, I grabbed the obfuscated code (the original scripts do not appear to be public anywhere) and added some small interface improvements. I did _not_ change the way colors are derived.

The color output matches that produced in the [Material Theme Editor for Sketch](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/), so it's a good companion for that.
