## What is this?

This is a (slightly modified) clone of the [official Material Design palette generator](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). It does a few things:

1. Builds you a full color palette from a given hex color
1. Provides you with complementary colors based off your primary color
1. Allows you to export the palettes as JSON or CSS variables

Both are based on Material Design standards, and use Google's algorithm for color derivation.

## Why is this?

Google's official palette generator [is embedded and buried deep within the Material docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). Since it's an inline tool, it's also hidden from search engines, making it difficult to discover or bookmark.

To make it a little easier to access and to preserve it for my own future use, I grabbed the obfuscated code (the original scripts do not appear to be public anywhere) and added some small interface improvements. I did _not_ change the way colors are derived.

## Plugins

- **Sketch:** After creating palettes and exporting the JSON data, Sketch users can create shared layer styles easily with the [Sketch JSON Color Palette Importer](https://github.com/ziyafenn/sketch-json-color-palette-importer) plugin.
- **VS Code:** Visual Studio Code users can take advantage of the [Material Design Palette Generator plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piyush-bhatt.vscode-mat-palette), inspired by and based on this project.
